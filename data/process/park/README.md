Something is wrong with the sequences in the SRA. They are very short
no longer than 60bp. The sequences uploaded cannot be what was used 
for the analysis based on the length. Thus errors in the sequences in
the data stored in the SRA make using this data set not possible.

Forutnately, it is small n (8/10/8)
